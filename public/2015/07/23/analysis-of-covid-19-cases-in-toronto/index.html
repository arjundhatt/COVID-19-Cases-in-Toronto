<p>What was done?
- Analysis to find significant informatin in COVID-19 Data’
What was found?
- Found that although mostly 20-60 yaer olds make up most cases, most deaths are in older
- Crucial becasue it shows who is most affected by the disease and most likely to die.
# intro</p>
<p>I will be doing an analysis of COVID cases. I will start by showing the age of most poeple affected. Then, the age of most fatalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="description-of-dataset" class="section level1">
<h1>Description of Dataset</h1>
<p>The dataset contains information related to the COVID-19 outbreak as reported by Toronto Public Health. For all confirmed and probable cases in Toronto, the dataset contains useful about the case such as age group, source of infection, and gender. The data is extracted from the provincial communicable disease reporting system along with Toronto’s custom COVID-19 case management system.</p>
</div>
<div id="important-findings" class="section level1">
<h1>Important Findings</h1>
<p>In the dataset, we are given the ‘age at time of illness’ for each individual that contracted COVID-19. Below is a histogram to show the age groups that are most affected:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(opendatatoronto)
covid_packages &lt;- search_packages(&quot;COVID&quot;)

covid_resources &lt;- covid_packages %&gt;%
  list_package_resources()

covid_statistics &lt;- covid_resources %&gt;%
  get_resource()

library(ggplot2)
#age of people who have covid 
agegroup&lt;-covid_statistics$`Age Group`  
ggplot(data=covid_statistics, aes(agegroup)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat=&quot;count&quot;)
## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: binwidth, bins, pad</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looking at the histogram, we can see that most cases are in people aged 20-60. For those younger than 20, or older than 60, the bar is much shorter indicating that less people are exposed to the virus. An explanation for this can be the fact that most of the working population is aged 20-60 and they are more likely to get exposed to the virus in their workplace. (Weakness/drawback– this can look a lot different if we got information after September when kids are gone back to school)</p>
<p>To investigate this further, we can also look at the outcome of each case to identify whether it was fatal or not:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>outcome &lt;- covid_statistics$Outcome
ggplot(data=covid_statistics, aes(outcome)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat=&quot;count&quot;)
## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: binwidth, bins, pad</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looking at the histogram, we can see that most of the cases are resolved, and in comparison to the cases that are resolved, very few are fatal. This poses the interesting question— among which age group are fatalities most common?</p>
<p>In order to see which age group has the most fatalities from the virus, I will start by filtering the dataset so that it only contains cases that are classified as ‘fatal’. After filtering the dataset, I will create a histogram to see the distribution of age groups to see which is most affected by the virus.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#filtering fatal outcomes
fataldata &lt;- subset(covid_statistics, outcome == &#39;FATAL&#39;)

ageoffatal &lt;- fataldata$`Age Group`
ggplot(data=fataldata, aes(ageoffatal)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat=&quot;count&quot;)
## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: binwidth, bins, pad</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looking at the histogram above, it is very clear that most fatal cases are in the older population. Because the height of the bar increases as the age group increases, we can see that the virus is more severe as you grow older. Surprisingly, there are no fatal cases in individuals less than 39 years old.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dataset only includes Toronto. Maybe if we had a different city we can generalize the results.</li>
<li>May look a lot different with September results.

<p>You can also embed plots. See Figure <a href="#fig:pie">1</a> for example:</p>

## #   in ICU` &lt;chr&gt;, `Ever Intubated` &lt;chr&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To investigate this further, we can also look at a histogram to see where the source of most infections are. Because the dataset contains a column detailing the ‘source of infection’, I will create a histogram to see which source is most popular:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>soi &lt;- covid_statistics$`Source of Infection`
ggplot(data=covid_statistics, aes(soi)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat=&quot;count&quot;)
## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: binwidth, bins, pad</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As shown in the histogram above, we can see that most cases are due to ‘Close contact’ or ‘N/A- Outbreak associated’. As defined in the dataset, ‘Close contact’ is someone who was ‘in close contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case’, while ‘N/A- Outbreak associated’ is unsurprisable defined as an ‘outbreak-associated case’.</p>
