      <description>Introduction We use @citetidyverse
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends in the fatal cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Before beginning the analysis, I wanted to see whether the older population is more at risk from COVID-19 compared to the younger population. Using data from the city of Toronto, I wanted to observe the distribution of age groups among fatal COVID-19 cases. To begin the analysis, I looked at the age groups for all COVID-19 cases — including those that did not result in fatalities — to get an idea of the age groups that were most exposed to the virus.</description>
